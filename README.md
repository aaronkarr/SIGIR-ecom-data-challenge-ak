# SIGIR eCOM 2021 Data Challange Dataset
_Public Data Release 1.0.0_

### Overview
Coveo will host the 2021 [SIGIR eCom](https://sigir-ecom.github.io/) Data Challenge and this repository will contain utility scripts and information about data preparation and testing for the Challenge.

This page is a WIP - please come back often in the upcoming weeks to check for updates and for the final dataset.

### License

The dataset is available for research and educational purposes at this page. To obtain the dataset, you are required to fill a form with information about you and your institution, and agree to the Terms And Conditions for fair usage of the data. For convenience, Terms And Conditions are also included in a pure `txt` format in this repo: usage of the data implies the acceptance of these Terms And Conditions. 

If you submit to the 2021 Data Challenge leaderboard, you are _required to release your code under an open source license_.
